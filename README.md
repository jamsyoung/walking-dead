# Walking Dead Images
This is a collection of Walking Dead comic book covers.  I use this as a
screensaver.  Most all OSs have some sort of screensaver that will let you point
it to a directory full of images.

Here is a screenshot from the "Shifting Tiles" screensaver on OS X.

## File Structure

- `/books` - Covers of the Omnibus books.

- `/desktop` - Desktop wallpapers.

- `/issues/animated` - Animated gif dressed issue covers.  I have only found
  one, ever.

- `/issues/dressed` - Dressed issue covers.

- `/issues/undressed` - Undressed issue covers.

- `/other` - Other images I found that seemed worth saving.

- `/teasers` - Teasers that were released.  Technically these are just undressed
  issue covers.

- `/volumes` - Covers for the 6-issue volumes.


## Contributing
If you have images that I don't have, please contribute!  You can add in through
a pull request, or open an issue with a link where I can download the image and add it in myself.
